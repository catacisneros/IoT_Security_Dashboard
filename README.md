# 🔐 IoT Security Dashboard

A real-time dashboard for monitoring and securing IoT devices using **Node.js**, **Power BI**, and simulated data streams.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time IoT monitoring system built as a personal portfolio project. It simulates IoT device behavior, identifies potential security events, and visualizes key metrics in Power BI.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (or InfluxDB for time-series data)
- **Data Simulation:** Node.js with Faker.js, MQTT/WebSocket
- **Visualization:** Power BI (Desktop)
- **APIs:** RESTful JSON endpoints
